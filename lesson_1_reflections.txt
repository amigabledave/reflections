It was really usefull to have the lines that changed pinpointed rather than having to check one line at the time.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Il will make it easier to try new things without any fear of messing up the code since it will be supper easy to go back to previews versions. Also I will save time by not having to manualy change the names of the multiple versions of my files.
